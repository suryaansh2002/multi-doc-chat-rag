## Overview

This project is a Document Q&A System that allows users to upload PDF documents, process them into chunks, and interact with them through a chat interface. The system leverages MongoDB for document storage, Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval, and OpenAI for generating responses based on document content. The project is divided into two main parts: a server-side application and a client-side application.

## Features

### Server-Side Application

- **File Uploads**: Users can upload PDF documents, which are processed and stored in MongoDB.
- **Document Processing**: Uploaded documents are parsed, split into chunks, and embedded into vectors using OpenAI's embedding model.
- **Vector Storage**: Vectors are stored in Pinecone, allowing for efficient retrieval and querying.
- **Chat Interface**: Users can query the documents through a chat interface, receiving responses generated by OpenAI based on the document content.

### Client-Side Application

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload PDF files through a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Document List**: Displays a list of uploaded documents with options to select and delete them.
- **Chat Interface**: Allows users to ask questions about the documents and receive AI-generated responses.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Pinecone account and API key
- OpenAI account and API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the necessary variables for MongoDB, OpenAI, and Pinecone.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install` to install server-side dependencies.
   - Navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm install` to install client-side dependencies.

4. **Start the Server**: In the `server` directory, run `npm start` to start the server. The server will run on port 3001 by default.

5. **Start the Client**: In the `client` directory, run `npm run dev` to start the client application. The client will run on port 3000 by default.

## Project Structure

### Server

- **Main Entry Point**: The server application is initialized in a main file that sets up Express, connects to MongoDB, and defines routes.
  - Reference: `server/server.js` (startLine: 1, endLine: 36)

- **Routes**: Handles API endpoints for uploading and querying documents. There are separate routes for managing uploads and chat interactions.
  - Upload Route: `server/routes/upload.js` (startLine: 1, endLine: 91)
  - Chat Route: `server/routes/chat.js` (startLine: 1, endLine: 38)

- **Services**: Contains logic for interacting with external services like OpenAI and Pinecone.

- **Models**: Defines MongoDB schemas for storing document metadata and vector IDs.

### Client

- **Pages**: Defines the main pages of the application, including the home page for document management and a chat page for interactions.
  - Home Page: `client/src/pages/index.js` (startLine: 7, endLine: 107)
  - Chat Page: `client/src/pages/chat.js` (startLine: 1, endLine: 42)

- **Components**: Reusable UI components for file uploads, document lists, and chat interactions.
  - Chat Component: `client/src/components/Chat.js` (startLine: 7, endLine: 68)

- **Styles**: Global styles for the application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different components and pages.

## Deployment

- **Server**: Deployed on Vercel at [https://multi-doc-chat-rag.vercel.app/](https://multi-doc-chat-rag.vercel.app/)
- **Client**: Deployed on Vercel at [https://multi-doc-chat-rag-client.vercel.app/](https://multi-doc-chat-rag-client.vercel.app/)


## Navigation

- **Uploading Documents**: Navigate to the client application in your browser. Use the upload interface to select and upload PDF documents.
- **Viewing Documents**: Uploaded documents will appear in a list. You can select documents to interact with them.
- **Chatting with Documents**: Use the chat interface to ask questions about the selected documents. The system will generate responses based on the document content.
